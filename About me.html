<h2 style="border:2px solid black;">About Me</h2>
<p>
    I'm Sonam Seldon,and i'm passionate about music,especially artists like Central Cee,Lil Tjay,XXXtentacion,
    Juice WRLD,2pac and etc.Their songs inspire me and connect with my experiences.i'm also on a mission to learn 
    HTML and CSS,which i find really exciting.i enjoyed creating things,whether its through coding or music.<br><br>In my free time,i love going to live performances and dreaming about the day i might see my favorite artists on stage.Music is a big part of my life,I believe that experiencing music in person brings it to life in a way that recordings cannot.and i can't wait to explore more about it and share my journey with others.i look forward to continuing my journey in both music and coding,sharing my passions with others,and hopefully inspiring them along the way.When i'm not diving into music or coding,i love spending time with friends and exploring new insterest.Whether its going to local concerts,hanging out,or just chilling at home,i appreciate the moments i share with others.i also enjoy discovering new artists,as music is a never-ending journey.i look forward to continuing to grow as a person,both in my passions for music and technology,and i hope to inspire others along the way.
